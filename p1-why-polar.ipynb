    "## <strong style=\"color:#5e17eb\"> What is Polars </strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Polars** is a fast DataFrame library for Python (and Rust) designed for working with large datasets. It is optimized for performance and parallelism, making it a strong alternative to **Pandas** in situations where speed and scalability are important.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Core Feature**: Polars is written in **Rust**, which gives it a significant performance boost over Python-based libraries.\n",
    "* It is designed to support **multithreading** and **vectorized execution** (similar to **NumPy**), enabling it to handle large datasets much more efficiently than pandas, especially on machines with multiple cores.\n"

    "## <strong style=\"color:#5e17eb\"> Why is Polars Fast </strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Rust Backend**:\n",
    "   Polars uses **Rust** as its core implementation language, which is known for being **highly efficient** in terms of memory management and speed. Rust ensures that operations are performed in a way that minimizes overhead and maximizes throughput.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multithreading**:\n",
    "   Unlike **Pandas**, which is designed for single-threaded execution, Polars can take advantage of **multiple CPU cores** to speed up data processing. This is especially important for larger datasets and parallel computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Columnar Memory Layout**:\n",
    "   Like **Arrow** and **Apache Parquet**, Polars stores data in a **columnar** format. This allows for efficient data access patterns, making data processing much faster, particularly for operations that target a small subset of columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data)**:\n",
    "   Polars can leverage **SIMD** for vectorized operations, further speeding up computation by applying the same operation to multiple data points simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Efficient Serialization**:\n",
    "   Polars’ data structures are designed for efficient serialization, reducing overhead when reading from or writing to disk.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Eager Execution**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* In **eager execution**, operations are performed **immediately** when they are called.\n",
    "* This is how Pandas operates by default, which is fine for smaller datasets but can lead to performance bottlenecks when working with large data.\n",
    "* Example: If you ask Pandas to perform an operation (like filtering, joining, or aggregating), it processes the data right then and there, even if later operations might reduce the size of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Lazy Execution** (Polars):\n",
    "\n",
    "* In **lazy execution**, no computations are actually performed until an **action** (like `.collect()`) is called. This allows for **optimizations** to be applied across the entire computation chain.\n",
    "* Polars builds a **logical plan** of the operations and only executes the minimal steps required when `.collect()` is invoked.\n",
    "* This results in **significant performance improvements** because redundant computations are eliminated, and the execution engine can make smart optimizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key benefits**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Query optimization**: Polars can **reorder** operations, push down filters, and optimize joins.\n",
    "* **Memory efficiency**: By executing only what’s necessary, memory consumption is lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Polars:\n",

    "## <strong style=\"color:#5e17eb\"> Tips for Handling Big Data with Polars </strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use Lazy Execution**:\n",
    "   For large datasets, always prefer **lazy execution**. This will allow Polars to optimize the operations, reducing unnecessary memory consumption and computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use Multithreading**:\n",
    "   Make sure your machine has multiple CPU cores, and Polars will automatically parallelize operations across them. This is one of the biggest advantages over Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use Efficient Data Formats**:\n",
    "   Polars supports **Arrow** and **Parquet** formats, which are columnar storage formats. When dealing with big data, store your data in these formats as they are optimized for both **compression** and **speed**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Limit Memory Usage**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Filter early**: Apply filters as early as possible in your data pipeline.\n",
    "   * **Chunking**: If the dataset doesn’t fit in memory, break it into smaller chunks and process them one by one.\n",
    "   * Use **`scan`** instead of `read` to lazily load data and only read what is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Avoid Large Data Copies**:\n",
    "   Polars minimizes memory usage by avoiding **unnecessary copies** of the data, especially when performing transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Use Aggregations and Joins Efficiently**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * When working with large datasets, reduce the number of joins and aggregations you do early on.\n",
    "   * In **lazy execution**, Polars will optimize joins and reduce intermediate data sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Batch Processing**:\n",
    "   For extremely large datasets, **process data in batches**. You can load chunks of your data into memory and perform operations on each chunk individually.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Expression System**:\n",
    "   The **Polars expression system** allows for efficient, deferred evaluation of computations, giving you fine-grained control over data transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Integration with Arrow**:\n",
    "   Polars uses **Apache Arrow** as its memory format. This enables it to easily interact with other systems like **Apache Spark**, **Dask**, and **PyArrow**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **DataFrame API**:\n",
    "   Polars offers a highly flexible and intuitive API that mimics Pandas but with added performance benefits. It supports familiar operations such as filtering, aggregation, sorting, etc.\n"
