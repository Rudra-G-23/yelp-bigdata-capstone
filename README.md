# 🧠 Yelp Big Data Analysis using Polars

This repository contains a **beginner-friendly, step-by-step big data analysis project** using the **Yelp Dataset**.  
The project demonstrates how to efficiently handle and analyze massive JSON data using the Polars library in Python — a high-performance alternative to pandas, built for speed and scalability.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

The **Yelp dataset** is quite large, and traditional libraries like `pandas` struggle with performance and memory limits.  
To tackle this, I used **Polars**, a fast DataFrame library written in Rust, that offers blazing speed for large-scale data operations.

### Key Highlights:
- Processed large **JSON** files from the Yelp dataset.
- Converted JSON files into optimized formats like **CSV** and **Parquet**.
- Performed detailed step-by-step data analysis with Polars.
- Each step focuses on core Polars functionality, from Series to advanced operations.

## 🧾 Data Conversion Steps

1. **JSON → CSV**  
   Converted raw Yelp JSON files into CSV format for compatibility and inspection.

2. **JSON → Parquet**  
   Converted to Parquet format for efficient storage and faster I/O performance.
